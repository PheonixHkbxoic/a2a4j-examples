question: http://localhost:8900/chat?userId=1&sessionId=2&prompts=what%20is%20miles  
answer:  
At **Miles of Smiles Car Rental Services**, "Miles" refers to:

1. **Our Company Name**: "Miles of Smiles" is our brand identity as a car rental service provider.

2. **Mileage Policy**: While our standard rental agreements include unlimited mileage for most vehicles, some specialty
   or premium rentals may have mileage restrictions. Any applicable mileage limits or fees would be clearly stated in
   your rental agreement.

3. **Vehicle Usage**: The term also reflects our commitment to helping you travel ("miles") with happiness ("smiles").

Would you like me to check:

- The mileage policy for a specific vehicle class?
- Your current rental's mileage terms?
- Or assist with any other car rental service?

I'm happy to provide details relevant to your rental needs!
